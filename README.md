# Predicting Drug-Related Executions during the Philippine Drug War
This project reproduces and modifies a negative binomial model from Religious Protection from Populist Violence: The Catholic Church and the Philippine Drug War (Brooke et al., 2023). Specifically, I replicate the fourth and most complex model from Table 1 (p. 213) of the original study.

## Project Overview
The original study examined the influence of Roman Catholic parishes on the number of drug-related killings in barangays (the smallest administrative units) within the National Capital Region of the Philippines during Rodrigo Duterteâ€™s administration. The model assesses whether the presence of a parish correlates with a reduction in extrajudicial killings. I make some additions to the original model which significantly improve its fit and ability to predict, and re-evaluate the authors' original claim that having a Catholic parish reduces the expected number of drug-related killings in a given barangay.
